# StreamDAO - Solidity Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to **StreamDAO**, a project created as part of my Solidity learning journey. This repository showcases my exploration of smart contract development, testing, and deployment using Solidity, Foundry, and OpenZeppelin libraries.

---

## Overview

StreamDAO is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create, manage, and interact with token streams. The project demonstrates key Solidity concepts such as:

- **ERC20 Token Integration**: Handling token transfers and approvals.
- **Time-Based Logic**: Using `block.timestamp` and `vm.warp` for time-dependent operations.
- **Event Emission**: Emitting and testing events for contract interactions.
- **Access Control**: Restricting functions to specific roles (e.g., payers, recipients).
- **Testing with Foundry**: Writing and running comprehensive tests for smart contracts.

---

## Features

- **Stream Creation**: Payers can create token streams for recipients with specified durations and amounts.
- **Stream Cancellation**: Payers can cancel active streams.
- **Token Withdrawal**: Recipients can withdraw tokens from active streams.
- **Event Emission**: Emits events for key actions like stream creation and cancellation.
- **Time Manipulation**: Simulates time progression using Foundry's `vm.warp`.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html): A blazing-fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Required for managing dependencies like OpenZeppelin.
- An Ethereum RPC URL (e.g., from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/)).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/StreamDAO.git
   cd StreamDAO
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
   ```

3. Add OpenZeppelin remappings:
   ```bash
   echo "@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/" >> remappings.txt
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

---

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Set Up an Environment File:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your Ethereum RPC URL (e.g., from Alchemy or Infura):
     ```
     .comRPC_URL=https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
     PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
     ```

   - Replace `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your Alchemy API key and `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with the private key of the account you want to use for deployment.

2. **Install Foundry's `dotenv` Plugin:**
   - Install the `dotenv` plugin to load environment variables:
     ```bash
     forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
     ```

---

### Deployment Script

The deployment script is located in the DeployStreamDAO.s.sol file. It deploys the `StreamDAO` contract to the specified network.

#### Example Deployment Script:
```solidity
// filepath: /script/DeployStreamDAO.s.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {StreamDAO} from "../src/StreamDAO.sol";

contract DeployStreamDAO is Script {
    function run() external {
        address deployer = vm.envAddress("PRIVATE_KEY");
        vm.startBroadcast(deployer);

        StreamDAO streamDAO = new StreamDAO();

        console.log("StreamDAO deployed at:", address(streamDAO));

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

---

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Compile the Contracts:**
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

2. **Run the Deployment Script:**
   ```bash
   forge script script/DeployStreamDAO.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
   ```

   - Replace `$RPC_URL` with your Ethereum RPC URL.
   - Replace `$PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key.

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check the console output for the deployed contract address.

---

## Usage

### Stream Creation

Payers can create streams for recipients by specifying:
- The token address.
- The total amount to be streamed.
- The start and end timestamps.

### Stream Cancellation

Payers can cancel active streams, stopping further withdrawals.

### Token Withdrawal

Recipients can withdraw tokens from active streams based on the elapsed time.

---

## Testing

This project uses Foundry for testing. Key tests include:
- **Stream Creation**: Ensures streams are created with the correct parameters.
- **Stream Cancellation**: Verifies that streams can be canceled by payers.
- **Token Withdrawal**: Tests that recipients can withdraw the correct amounts.
- **Event Emission**: Confirms that events are emitted as expected.

Run all tests with:
```bash
forge test
```

---

## Solidity Concepts Explored

- **Smart Contract Design**: Structuring contracts for modularity and security.
- **Time-Based Logic**: Using `block.timestamp` and `vm.warp` for time-sensitive operations.
- **Event Testing**: Using `vm.expectEmit` to test emitted events.
- **Access Control**: Implementing role-based restrictions with custom modifiers.

---

## Tools and Libraries

- **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)**: For building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **[OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/)**: For secure and reusable Solidity components.
- **[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)**: The programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
